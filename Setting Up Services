1) Setup the service:
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/add-users.service

#add this to the file:
[Unit]
Description=Add Users
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/add-users.sh
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

#save and exit
This will start the service whenever a multi-user (runlevel 5) boot is initiated.  It points to the script in /usr/bin/add-users.sh - so let's make that next.

2) make the boot script:

This script will run every time the computer boots, and checks to make sure the user exists, has a home, owns said home, and can read, write, and execute in that folder.
sudo nano /usr/bin/add-users.sh

#add this to the file:

#!/bin/bash
declare -a names=("guest_user" "guest_user2" "guest_user3")

for i in "${names[@]}"
do

#check if user exists
if grep -q $i /etc/passwd; then : ; else useradd $i -p $(openssl passwd -1 learningR) -d /home/$i -m ; fi

#check if user home exists
if [ -d /home/$i ]; then : ; else mkdir -p /home/$i; fi
#force owned by user and not root
chown $i /home/$i; fi

#check if user home has correct permisisons
if [ -r /home/$i ] && [ -w /home/$i ] && [ -x /home/$i ]; then : ; else chmod 755 /home/$i; fi
done

#save and exit


You can change the users by changing the first line, and change the default password by changing "learningR" to whatever you'd like.

3) make it executable
sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/add-users.sh

4) set the service to start at boot
sudo systemctl enable add-users.service

5) reboot and check to see if it worked!
